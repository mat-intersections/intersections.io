The Intersections committee is looking for speakers to deliver talks around the ethics and the politics of media and arts technology. We aim to reach to a diverse range of speakers including artists, technologists, and researchers.

The topics might include, but not limited to, media arts consumption and ethical consumerism, self-censorship, appropriation of digital artworks. Please register your interest [here](mailto:info@intersections.io).

Check out this yearâ€™s [programme](#) for more details.
