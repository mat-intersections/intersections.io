Our social, political and community lives are increasingly lived through and mediated by technology. From political uprisings arranged on social media advances into DIY gene editing, technology's influence is profoundly changing the political sphere, and raising important ethical questions.

Following the rise of unprecedented activism and political protests of the year, Inter/sections 2017 will explore how artists use different networks, databases, and systems in order to raise awareness towards ethical and political issues around technologies. Through a week long programme of interactive artwork, we will engage with topics ranging from the ethics of data privacy to the political effects of social media. Free workshops, performances and talks with artists and technology activists will question how current political systems impact evolving technologies and introduce ways that technology can subvert them.
