### Symposium
The symposium will be held on **Friday 8 September**, and will feature our keynotes speakers, panels, and workshops, around the theme of politics and ethics within media, arts and technology.

<h3 class="u-cf">Exhibition</h3>
The Inter/sections exhibition, open to the public all week long, will showcase a range of installations and interactive artworks developed as part of the research by the programmeâ€™s postgraduate students, Digital Economy Network students, and commissioned artists working in the intersection of art and science.  
We are very excited to announce our commissioned artists who will be creating new media artworks for the Inter/sections exhibition:
 
**[Julian Oliver](https://julianoliver.com/output/)** is a critical engineer and artist based in Berlin. His works and lectures involve topics ranging from software art to data forensics. He is an advocate of Free and Open Source Software.
 
**[Will Hurt](http://willhurt.net/)** is an artist based in Norwich. He uses computers to produce work that draws on formal elements of architecture and the language of diagrams with the aim of engaging people with the built environment, often through play.

**MAT & DEN researcher-artists**: students from the MAT and DEN programmes will exhibit their final and ongoing media artworks throughout the week.

### Workshops

Throughout the week we will have workshops and performances spreading around the theme of politics and ethics of Media & Arts Technology. 
We have an exciting programme that will include family workshops on security and encryption; a workshop on ethical issues faced by artists and designers, artist talks from commissioned artists and Digital-Economy-Network artist/researchers. Additional sessions will include film screenings as a collaboration with Ethics & Drama department, and short documentary screenings from MAT students of all levels.
