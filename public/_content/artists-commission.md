For the first year, we announce the MAT Inter/sections Commission. Through a call for proposals, one or more artists will be asked to produce a new piece of media art for exhibition at Inter/Sections 2017. This commission includes up to Â£1000 to produce a work that reflects on the theme of Politics and Ethics in media and arts technology.

For further information please [read the call for artists](/docs/artists-commission.pdf).
